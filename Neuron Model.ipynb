    "##### Ryan - David Reyes rxr410\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a passive cable model using the neural parameters described in the McIntyre, Richardson, and Grill Paper provided in the reading. Your model shall consist of three dendrites connected to a cell body. The cell body is assumed to be a sphere with diameter 50 $\\mu$m, the dendrites are cylinders with the following diameters and lengths\n",
    "\n",
    "  D1: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * L=1mm\n",
    "    * d = 10 $\\mu$m\n",
    "    \n",
    "  D2: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * L = 1mm\n",
    "    * d = 20 $\\mu$m\n",
    "    \n",
    "  D3:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * L=300 $\\mu$m\n",
    "    * d = 20 $\\mu$m\n",
    "    \n",
    "  Show the change in potential at the cell body as a function of an injected square pulse of cathodal (depolarizing) current under the conditions listed below. After all of these modeling exercises, describe the influence of the diameter and length of the dendrites on processing of synaptic information.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * Same, single pulse input in the middle of each of the respective dendrites.\n",
    "   * Same, single pulse input equidistant from the cell body for each dendrite.\n",
    "   * Multiple input pulses of current at equidistance from the cell body for each dendrite for several frequencies.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Add an active axon to your model. Double the sodium channel density in the initial axon hillock segment of the axon. Repeat the scenarios above and describe the effects on the axon. Find input pulses that drive the axon to fire an action potential. The axon should be 20 $\\mu$m in diameter, is myelinated, and should consist of 20 nodes after the initial segment.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Rather than injecting a current internally at the node of the dendrite, add a synaptic current across the membrane. Use a single tau model and set tau to different values ranging from 50 $\\mu$s and th emaximum synaptic conductance initially equal tot he sodium conductance and then varied higher and lower. Explore spatial and temporal summation using your model. Vary the frequency of input pulses that are individually too small to cause axon excitement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Change the diameters of the cell body from 30 $\\mu$m to 100 $\\mu$m with active axons changing in proportion from 8 $\\mu$m to 20 $\\mu$m. Describe the impact of the size change on the dendritic input and on the axon excitation. For a fixed size, examine the effect of increasing intermodal spacing from 100*D to 500*D on action potential propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to represent the neuron, some background must be understood first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nernst potential\n",
    "\n",
    "The nernst potential describes what is known as the reverse potential. The reverse potential is where the transfer of an ion across a membrane is zero, as the amount of ion crossing the membrane due to diffusion is equal to the amount crossing due to the potential difference. The nernst potential is governed by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{ion} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[ion]_{out}}{[ion]_{in}} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{ion} = V_{in} - V_{out}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$R$ is the gas constant 8.314 J/K/Mol\n",
    "\n",
    "$T$ is temperature in kelvin\n",
    "\n",
    "$z$ is the valence of the ion\n",
    "\n",
    "$F$ is Faradays constant 96,485 C/mol\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $T$ is 37 C, then \n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{ion} = \\frac{26.7}{z} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[ion]_{out}}{[ion]_{in}} \\right)$$\n",
    "$$V_{ion} = \\frac{61.5}{z} \\log \\left( \\frac{[ion]_{out}}{[ion]_{in}} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### GHK equation\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple ions are involved in the diffusion, the following relation occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_{GHK} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\times \\ln \\left[ \\frac{\\sum_{+ions} P_{ion} [ion^+]_{out} + \\sum_{-ions} P_{ion} [ion^-]_{in}}{\\sum_{+ions}P_{ion}[ion^+]_{in} + \\sum_{-ions} P_{ion}[ion^-]_{out}}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_{ion}$ is the membrane permiability of that particular ion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In certain models, these potentials are represented as a battery which forces the node to the resting potential. However, in some models the potentials are omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passive Cable equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The passive cable equation is derived by assuming the dendrite is a cylinder. It assumes that all the ion channels on the membrane can be represented by a single resistor. $\\Delta x$ from the integration actually gets factored out and becomes a partial derivative term for the external voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_m + \\tau_m \\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial t} - \\lambda^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V_m}{\\partial x^2} - i_{inj} = \\lambda^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V_e}{\\partial x^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau_m = r_m c_m$$\n",
    "$$\\lambda = \\frac{r_m}{r_a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The cable equation represents the relationship between the membrane voltage, the external voltage, and any injected current.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conversion to code:\n",
    "\n",
    "The compartment model discretizes the continuous cable model by discrete steps for a compartment $j$, and assuming that the external voltage, $V_e$ is zero, we get the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{V_j}{R_m} + C_m \\frac{d V_j}{d t} -  \\frac{V_{j+1} - 2V_j + V_{j-1}}{r_a \\Delta x^2} - i_{inj} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you can generalize that the voltages of each compartment are related by different $r_a$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{V_j}{R_m} + C_m \\frac{d V_j}{d t} +  \\frac{V_j - V_{j+1}}{0.5\\cdot(R_{a,j}+R_{a,j+1})} +\\frac{V_j - V_{j-1}}{0.5\\cdot(R_{a,j}+R_{a,j-1})} - i_{inj} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where\n",
    "$$R_m =\\frac{r_m}{\\Delta x}$$\n",
    "$$C_m =c_m\\Delta x$$\n",
    "$$R_a =r_a\\Delta x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can rearrange the equation to get the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d V_j}{d t} = \\frac{1}{C_m}\\left[-\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x}{r_m} + \\frac{1}{0.5 \\cdot (R_{a,j} + R_{a,j+1})} + \\frac{1}{0.5 \\cdot (R_{a,j} + R_{a,j-1})} \\right)V_j + \\left(\\frac{1}{0.5\\cdot(R_{a,j}+R_{a,j+1})}\\right)V_{j+1}+ \\left(\\frac{1}{0.5\\cdot(R_{a,j}+R_{a,j-1})}\\right)V_{j-1} + i_{inj}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be rearranged into the following matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\frac{d V_{j}}{dt} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{d V_{j+1}}{dt} \\\\\n",
